/** @typedef {import("../2_wfc/2_components/bitmask.js").default} Bitmask */

// WFC
/**
 * @typedef {number[]} Direction An array of two numbers. The first stores y and the second stores x. Positive y points down while positive x points right.
 * 
 * @typedef {number[][]} TilemapImage A 2D matrix of tile IDs that represents a layer of a tilemap.
 * 
 * @typedef {number[][]} Pattern An 2D NxN matrix of tile IDs.
 *
 * @typedef {Bitmask} AdjacentPatternsBitmask Given a pattern A, stores which patterns are adjacent to A in a single direction.
 * @typedef {AdjacentPatternsBitmask[]} AdjacentPatternsMap An array of four AdjacentPatternsBitmasks. Given a pattern A, stores which patterns are adjacent to A in each of the four directions.
 * @typedef {Bitmask} PossiblePatternsBitmask Stores which patterns a cell can become.
 * 
 * @typedef {PossiblePatternsBitmask} Cell Currently the only info a cell needs to contain is its PossiblePatternsBitmask so for simplicity it is just that instead of an object containing it.
